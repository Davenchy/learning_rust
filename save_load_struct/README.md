# Save Load Structure

- In this project I tried to write a program in C that saves a struct to a binary file then load it back.

- Then I rewrite this program in rust with the help of Bard AI to do the same functionality.

## Run the C example

```sh
$ cd src/
$ gcc -o app main.c
$ ./app
```

## Run the rust example

```sh
$ cargo run
```
